# ArcHud2

ArcHUD displays smooth arcs around your character in the middle of the screen to inform you about the health and power (mana, rage, ...) of you, your pet, and your target.

### About this repository

This is a mirror of the final release of ArcHUD2, which is the last version that works on Vanilla WoW 1.12 (and Turtle WoW). It is *not* compatible with Classic or Retail; for that, see [ArcHUD3](https://github.com/nyyr/ArcHUD3).

## Installation

#### Easy mode

Use [GitAddonsManager](https://woblight.gitlab.io/overview/gitaddonsmanager/).

#### Manual instructions

1. Download the code (green **Code** button > **Download ZIP**)
2. Extract the ZIP to **<Path\To\WoW Folder>\Interface\Addons**
3. Rename the extracted folder to `ArcHUD2` (in other words, remove `-master` from the end)

Once you're done, the folder structure should be **<Path\To\WoW Folder>\Interface\Addons\ArcHUD2\ArcHUD2.toc**

## Configuration

Type `/archud config` to open the menu.
